Here is a Python script that automates the photo renaming process we just went through.


  This script will:
  1.  Read your mynote.txt file to understand the context for each day.
  2.  Go through each photo in the folder that hasn't been renamed yet.
  3.  Use the Gemini API to analyze the photo's content along with your notes.
  4.  Generate a new, descriptive filename.
  5.  Rename the file automatically.

  ### How to Use This Script


  1. Install the necessary library:
  Open your command line or terminal and run:
  `bash
  pip install google-generativeai
  `


  2. Set Your API Key:
  You need to provide your Google AI API key as an environment variable.


   * Windows (Command Prompt):
  `cmd
      set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
      `
     Windows (PowerShell):*

  `powershell
      $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
      `
     macOS/Linux:*

  `bash
      export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
      `
  Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual key.


  3. Save the Script:
  Save the code below as a file named rename_photos.py in the C:\Data\gemini-cli\photo-temp directory.


  4. Run the Script:
  Open your command line, navigate to the directory, and run the script:

  `bash
  cd C:\Data\gemini-cli\photo-temp
  python rename_photos.py
  `


  The script will then start renaming your files and print its progress.
